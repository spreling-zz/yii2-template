Yii2 Project Template
=====================

This is a skeleton [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for developing complex Web applications with mutiple tiers. 
It is derriven form the [Yii 2 Advanced Project Template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced/).  

The template includes three tiers: front end, back end, and console, each of which is a separate Yii application

The template is designed to work in a team development environment. It supports deploying the application in different environments.

In additon to the Yii 2 Advanced Project Template there is a restructure of the Directory Structure. This Template build arround the
idea of Modules and all the components even the core ones are wrapt in modules. Through this it becomes easy to deploy a collection
of pre build modules in this skeleton to quick build a website.

Documentation is at [docs/guide/README.md](docs/guide/README.md).
